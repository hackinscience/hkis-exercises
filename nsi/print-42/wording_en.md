Write a single line of code displaying the number 42.

## What you'll learn

In this exercise you'll learn to *use* a function by trying the
[`print`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) builtin
function.

A function is a named thing that does something specific:

- the `print` function displays what's given to it,
- the `len` function measures the thing we give to it,
- â€¦

The syntax to make a function work is called a "function call", to make `print`
display the string `"Hello world"` the syntax is:

```python
print("Hello world")
```

## Advice

You'll need a [number](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers)
and the [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) builtin function.

I'm not asking to print the string "42", (composed of two chars), but the number 42.
