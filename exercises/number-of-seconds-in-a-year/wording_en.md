Write a Python program displaying the number of seconds in 365 days.

You'll need the [print
function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) to
display the result.

You'll need the [`*` operator
](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers)
for the multiplications.

As an example, the number of seconds in a day can be printed using the
following code:

```python
print(60 * 60 * 24)
```
