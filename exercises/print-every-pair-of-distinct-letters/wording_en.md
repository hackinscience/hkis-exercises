Provide a script printing every possible pairs of two different letters.

Only lower case, one pair per line, ordered alphabetically.

Don't print pairs consisting of twice the same letter, such as 'aa', 'bb', etc...

So your output should look like:

```bash
$ python3 solution.py
ab
..
az
ba
bc
,,
zy
```
