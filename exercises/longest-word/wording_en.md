Write a function giving the longest word in a given text.

Your function should be named `longest_word`, take a single argument `text` and
return a string which should be the longest word in the given text.

Beware: the given text can span several lines.


## Example

```python
>>> longest_word("We want a SHRUBBERY")
"SHRUBBERY"
>>> longest_word("Shrubberies are great")
"Shrubberies"
```


## Advice

Read the documentation of the
[len](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) builtin
function.
