You found a safe. There's a numeric keypad on it...

The keypad is dirty, thanks to this you can easily spot that numbers
`1`, `5`, and `8` are frequently used. It's so clear that you guess no
other digit is in use in this code.

Write a script printing all combinations of `4` digits that use all of
those used digits.

Output one combination per line, separate digits using spaces, so your
output should look like:

```text
1 1 5 8
1 5 5 8
1 5 8 8
...
```
