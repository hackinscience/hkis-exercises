    You should work on this exercise with your own installation of Python,
    on your computer. Learn how for
    [Mac OSX](https://framagit.org/hackinscience/hkis-website/wikis/How-to-work-on-an-exercise-from-Mac-OSX)
    or [Windows](https://framagit.org/hackinscience/hkis-website/wikis/How-to-work-on-an-exercise-from-Windows).


Your script should be able to open a file named `words.txt` located in the same folder, compute the
frequency of every ascii lowercase letters in its content, and display them according to this format:

```
b: 0.02
p: 0.02
a: 0.07
o: 0.05
s: 0.09
d: 0.03
i: 0.07
m: 0.02
c: 0.03
```

I do not care about the order, only the values. No more precision, no
less precision, and I want the trailing zeros, meaning `1/2` should be
printed `0.50`.
