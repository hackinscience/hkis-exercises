Welcome on HackInScience!

This is a sample exercise just to familiarize with the system.

On the right, here, there's typically the exercise instructions, for
example: "Write a single line of Python code to display `Hello
world!`".

The code to solve the exercise is to be written in the black code
editor, on the left of the page.

But as it's just an example, I already wrote the code for you ☺

Below the instructions you can see some buttons, the more important is
the blue one, the `Submit` button used to send your answer to the
correction bot. The bot will review and test your code, and will tell
you if it's valid of if you have something to enhance.

Once your exercise approved by the correction bot, you'll be
authorized to read shared answers (middle button under the
instructions), and click on the `→` button to continue to the next
exercise.


## Advice

Start by reading the [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

Don't hesitate to modify the code and click the `Submit` button as
many times as needed to experiment with the syntax and possibilities.

But beware, the bot will still want you to print `Hello world!` to
validate the exercise!
