Simulate a perfect suffle of a deck of cards.

A [perfect shuffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW8zMwJF5ys&t=40)
of a deck of card is splitting a deck of cards into equal halves, and
perfectly interleaving them.

Perfectly shuffling `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` gives `[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]`.

(We consider that a deck of cards has an even number of cards.)

You'll expose a `perfect_shuffle(deck)` function, perfectly shuffling
the given iterable.

Did you know that if you shuffle 10 times a deck of 1024 cards, the
deck returns to its initial state ? It's probably a good way to test
your implementation.
