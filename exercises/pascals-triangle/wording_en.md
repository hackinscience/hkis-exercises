Write a **function** that **prints** Pascal's triangle.

Your function should be named `print_pascal_triangle` and accept a single
argument, the height of the triangle.

Your triangle should be properly displayed as a triangle (use spaces) like:

```text
  1
 1 1
1 2 1
```

or:

```text
                   1
                 1   1
               1   2   1
             1   3   3   1
           1   4   6   4   1
         1   5  10  10   5   1
       1   6  15  20  15   6   1
     1   7  21  35  35  21   7   1
   1   8  28  56  70  56  28   8   1
 1   9  36  84  126 126 84  36   9   1
```

Perfect alignment is not really possible: you can't align a two digit
number under a tree digit number, do your best.
