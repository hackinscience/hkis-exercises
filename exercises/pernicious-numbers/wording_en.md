Build a program taking no parameter.

The program will print the [pernicious
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernicious_number) in the
`range(222281, 222381)`

This exercises may be hard if you don't understand what a `pernicious
number` is, and is not mandatory to continue, so you can skip it.

One number per line, nothing else.

If the exercice were to be in the `range(100, 110)` should print:

```
$ ./solution.py
100
103
104
107
109
```

Because:

 - 100 is 1100100 in base 2, 3 ones: prime number of ones.
 - 103 is 1100111 in base 2, 5 ones: prime number of ones.
 - 104 is 1101000 in base 2, 3 ones: prime number of ones.
 - 107 is 1101011 in base 2, 5 ones: prime number of ones.
 - 109 is 1101101 in base 2, 5 ones: prime number of ones.
