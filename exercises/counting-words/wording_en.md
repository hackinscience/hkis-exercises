Provide a script that prints the number of words in the given paragraph.


I prefilled the answer box with the paragraph, in a variable, but in case you lose it, here it is:

```python
whetting_your_appetite = "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object oriented programming. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. For a description of standard objects and modules..."
```


## Advice

Take a look at the [`split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) method.
