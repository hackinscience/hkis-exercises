Write a script that print the factorial of 27.

Use the
[factorial](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.factorial)
function from the [math
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html).

## Advice

You'll need to `import` the `math` module. The `math` module, as well
as many others, are packaged with Python, you don't have nothing to
install on your computer, if you have Python it's already here.

Have a look at [the standard modules section in this tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#standard-modules)
and the [import statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import).
