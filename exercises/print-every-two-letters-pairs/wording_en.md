Provide a script printing every possible pairs of two letters, only lower case, one by line, ordered alphabetically.

So your output should look like:
```
$ python3 solution.py
aa
ab
...
ba
bb
...
zz
```

Don't write down manually the whole alphabet, use [string.ascii_lowercase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html).
