This is the last exercise of the « realist » category, maybe you (soon) completed all exercises.

First things first: Congratulations! Hope you enjoyed the trip, and you learned a few things ☺

Maybe you want more exercises? Sorry there's no "click here, give me money, and it'll unlock more"...

But HackInScience is free and open-source, meaning there's two ways you can get more exercises:

- Redact a new one yourself: https://framagit.org/hackinscience/hkis-exercises.
- [Donate](https://www.hackinscience.org/sponsor/) so I can get more free dedicate to work on my open-source proejcts.
