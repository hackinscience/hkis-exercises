Write a program printing the actual date (year month day hour minute and seconds) in a human readable format.

It should look like this:

```text
Today is 2015-09-17 and it is 09:34:35.
```

Beware the width is constant: 9h should displayed as 09:00:00, not 9:00:00, same for the month, day, and so on.
