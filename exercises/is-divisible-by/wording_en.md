Create a program to find and print all numbers between from 0 to 1000
(both included), that are divisible by 7 and whose digits sum
are divisible by 3.

For instance, `1512` is divisible by 7 and the sum of all is digits is `9` and is divisible by 3.

## Example

If the exercice were to make the same computation but in the `range(1500, 1700)`, 
the solution should print:

```
$ ./solution.py
1512
1533
1554
1575
1596
1617
1638
1659
1680
```
